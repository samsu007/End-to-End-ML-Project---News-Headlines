"# End-to-End-ML-Project---News-Headlines" 


This is a Sample Project (Sentimental Analysis using News headlines)
In this Project we deal with basic preprocessing like removing unwanted columns and special characters etc.,.
Next we create a bag of words using Countvector(from sklearn lib)
Next we Predict the model using Random Forest classifier
Next we calculate the accuracy score and classification reports
Finally we implement this model using flask api
